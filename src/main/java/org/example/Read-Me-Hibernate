A list of commonly used Hibernate annotations, which are essential for developers working with Hibernateâ€”
a framework in Java for mapping objects to database tables. Here's a breakdown of the annotations mentioned:

----->Annotations in Hibernate

-->@Entity
----->Marks a class as a JPA entity, meaning it is mapped to a database table.
----->Each instance of the class corresponds to a row in the table.

-->@Table
----->Specifies the details of the database table associated with the entity.
----->You can define attributes like the table name using name (e.g., @Table(name = "brands")).

-->@Id
----->Indicates the primary key of an entity.
----->It is mandatory for every entity and often used alongside @GeneratedValue for automatic ID generation.

-->@GeneratedValue
----->Used with @Id to automatically generate unique primary key values during persistence.
----->Supports strategies like GenerationType.IDENTITY, GenerationType.AUTO, and others for ID generation.

-->@Column
----->Maps a field to a specific column in the database table.
----->Allows customization of column attributes such as name, length, and uniqueness (e.g., @Column(name = "brandName")).

-->@Transient
----->Marks a field or property that should not be persisted to the database.
----->Useful for fields that are derived or calculated (e.g., @Transient private String fullName;).
